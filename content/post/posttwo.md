Why Me

As soon as I applied for LFX Mentorship with this project, I started learning the technologies I will need for this project. I stated with Golang since I thought that in order to understand Hugo, I first need to learn Golang. Then I learned Hugo through documentations. I made few projects on Hugo and then started learning Figma.
